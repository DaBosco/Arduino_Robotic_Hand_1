# Disclaimer: it is only a very basic prototype; in future I will build a more complex one.

I created a very basic robotic hand.

First I build the mechanical structure. I utilized a Totem Maker Kit (https://totemmaker.net/product/totem-maker-kit/) for mechanical parts, and rubber bands for hand ligaments. For mucles, I utilized servos and nylon wires.

Then I created an Arduino project to make everything move.
